### Challengs

During the development of this game, I encountered several challenges, the most important being the application of logic, since it is one of my weakest areas. Also, I had never programmed in C++ before only in C#, so I had a few weeks to learn the basics on my own. On a personal leveI had a very positive experience working on this project.  It was an opportunity to explore new concepts, expand my programming skills, and delve into text-based game development in an unfamiliar language for me. The process was challenging and rewarding.

Good luck and enjoy the game!
